Understanding Specialization
============================

The goal of CBI is to help developers to reason about how a code base
uses *specialization* to adapt to the capabilities and requirements of the
different platforms it supports. By measuring specialization, we can reason
about its impact upon maintenance effort.


Platforms
#########

The definition of *platform* used by CBI was first introduced in
"`Implications of a Metric for Performance Portability`_", and is shared
with the `P3 Analysis Library`_:

  A collection of software and hardware on which an *application* may run a
  *problem*.

.. _Implications of a Metric for Performance Portability:
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.08.007

.. _P3 Analysis Library:
   https://intel.github.io/p3-analysis-library/

This definition is deliberately very flexible, so a platform can represent
**any** execution environment for which code may be specialized. A platform
could be a compiler, an operating system, a micro-architecture or some
combination of these options.


Specialization
##############

There are many forms of specialization. What they all have in common is that
these *specialization points* act as branches: different code is executed
on different platforms based on some set of conditions. These conditions
express a platform's capabilities, properties of the input problem, or both.

The simplest form of specialization point is a run-time branch, which is easily
expressed but can incur run-time overheads and prevent compiler optimizations.
Compile-time specialization avoids these issues, and in practice a lot of
specialization is performed using preprocessor tools or with some kind of
metaprogramming.


Code Divergence
###############

Code divergence is a metric proposed by Harrell and Kitson in "`Effective
Performance Portability`_", which uses the Jaccard distance to measure the
distance between two source codes.

For a given set of platforms, :math:`H`, the code divergence :math:`CD` of
an application :math:`a` solving problem :math:`p` is an average of
pairwise distances:

.. math::
    CD(a, p, H) = \binom{|H|}{2}^{-1}
                  \sum_{\{i, j\} \in \binom{H}{2}} {d_{i, j}(a, p)}

where :math:`d_{i, j}(a, p)` represents the distance between the source
code required by platforms :math:`i` and :math:`j` for application
:math:`a` to solve problem :math:`p`.

The distance is calculated as:

.. math::
    d_{i, j}(a, p) = 1 - \frac{|c_i(a, p) \cap c_j(a, p)|}
                              {|c_i(a, p) \cup c_j(a, p)|}

where :math:`c_i` and :math:`c_j` are the lines of code required to compile
application :math:`a` and solve problem :math:`p` using platforms :math:`i`
and :math:`j`. A distance of 0 means that all code is shared between the
two platforms, whereas a distance of 1 means that no code is shared.

.. note::

    It is sometimes useful to talk about code *convergence* instead, which is
    simply the code divergence subtracted from 1.

Platform Coverage
#################

Platform coverage builds on the well-established concept of "test coverage",
and measures the amount of code in a code base that is utilized by a set of
platforms. Computing platform coverage is straightforward: it is simply the
number of lines of code used by one or more platforms expressed as a percentage
of the number of lines of code in the code base.

.. important::
    CBI often uses "coverage" as a shorthand for "platform coverage"!

Formally, for a given set of platforms, :math:`H`, the coverage for an
application :math:`a` solving problem :math:`p` is:

.. math::
    \textrm{Coverage}(a, p, H) = \frac{\left|\bigcup_{i \in H} c_i(a,p)\right|}
                                      {\left|\bigcup_{i \in H} c_i(a,p)\right| + \left|\bigcap_{i \in H} c_i'(a,p)\right|} \times 100

where :math:`c_i` is the set of lines of code required to compile application
:math:`a` and solve problem :math:`p` using platform :math:`i`, and
:math:`c_i'` is the complement of that set (i.e., the set of lines of code
*not* required). A coverage of 0% means that none of the code is used by any
platform, whereas a coverage of 100% means that all of the code is used by at
least one platform.

Measuring coverage can also help us to reason about differences between
platforms. The *average* coverage (over platforms) allows us to reason about
the amount of code covered by *all* platforms.

Formally, the average coverage is:

.. math::
    \textrm{Average Coverage}(a, p, H) = \frac{\sum_{h \in H} \textrm{Coverage}(a, p, h)}
                                              {\left|H\right|}

An average coverage of 0% means that none of the code is used by any platform,
whereas an average coverage of 100% means that all of the code is used by all
platforms.

.. tip::
    Low average coverage does not always mean the platforms in :math:`H` share
    little code; low average coverage can result from a high amount of unused
    code. Presenting coverage alongside average coverage provides the most insight.

The straightforward nature of coverage and average coverage has several
advantages. First, it is very easy to intuit the impact of a code change upon
coverage. Second, it is simple to use and understand in hierarchical contexts
(e.g., the number of used lines for a directory is the sum of the used lines
over all files in the directory). For these reasons, CBI functionality focused
on understanding potential improvements to code structure tend to use coverage
instead of divergence.
