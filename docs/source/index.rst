Code Base Investigator (CBI) is an analysis tool that provides insight into the
portability and maintainability of an application's source code.

- Measure "code divergence" and "platform coverage" to understand how much code
  is :doc:`specialized <specialization>` for different compilers, operating
  systems, hardware micro-architectures and more.

- Visualize the distance between the code paths used to support different
  compilation targets.

- Identify stale, legacy, code paths that are unused by any compilation target.

- Export metrics and code path information required for P3 analysis using
  `other tools`_.

Installation
############

The latest release of CBI is version 2.0.0. To download and install this
release, run the following::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/intel/code-base-investigator@2.0.0

We strongly recommend installing CBI within a virtual environment, to simplify
dependency management and improve security. Some alternative methods of
creating a virtual environment are shown below.

.. tab:: venv

    .. code-block:: text

        $ git clone --branch 2.0.0 https://github.com/intel/code-base-investigator.git
        $ python3 -m venv cbi
        $ source cbi/bin/activate
        $ cd code-base-investigator
        $ pip install .

.. tab:: uv

    .. code-block:: text

        $ git clone --branch 2.0.0 https://github.com/intel/code-base-investigator.git
        $ cd code-base-investigator
        $ uv tool install .

Getting Started
###############

Using CBI to analyze a code base is a three step process. For more detailed
information on any of these steps, we recommend that you work through the
tutorial using the :doc:`sample code base<sample-code-base>`.


1. **Generate a compilation database for each platform**

   You can use the |CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS option|_ with `CMake`_,
   intercept the compilation of an application using `Bear`_, or write a
   database manually.

   .. _`CMake`: https://cmake.org/
   .. _`Bear`: https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear

.. |CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS option| replace:: :code:`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` option
.. _CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS option: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html


2. **Create a TOML file describing the analysis**

   CBI reads platform definitions from a `TOML`_ file, like the one shown
   below:

   .. code:: toml

       [platform.cpu]
       commands = "cpu/compile_commands.json"

       [platform.gpu]
       commands = "gpu/compile_commands.json"

   .. _`TOML`: https://toml.io/en/


3. **Launch CBI**

   To perform a full analysis, launch ``codebasin`` with no arguments except
   the input TOML file:

   .. code:: text

       $ codebasin analysis.toml

   To see the other options that are available, run ``codebasin -h``.
